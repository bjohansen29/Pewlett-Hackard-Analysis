# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview
Analysis performed on behalf of client Bobby in order to examine several employment factors within company Pewlett Hackard. The company is interested in examining the upcoming potential retirees, the impact of these retirements on specific departments, and a developed list of potential retirees who may be eligible to participate in a mentorship program for younger employees.

## Deliverables

### An Examination of Retiring Employees

#### Retirement Titles
After defining potential retirees as any currently active employees born between January 1 of 1952 and December 31 of 1955, a data set was created titled Retirement Titles. The full data set represents tens of thousands of employees, so is not easily viewed in a full report. It is important to note that due to the factors used in the creation of the data set, individual potential retirees appear in the data set multiple times according to the number of titles they have held with the company.

#### Unique Titles
In order to more precisely look at the individual employees potentially retiring, a separate data set was pulled using on the current titles. This data set still represents tens of thousands of employees, but has the advantage of containing each employee only once.

#### Retiring Titles
At the request of the client, a separate set of data was created to examine the broad impact of these upcoming potential retirements on individual departments. A list of the total number of expected retirements by title was generated. It is important to note that, while many departments may have distinct titles, further analysis should be done breaking out these title counts by department. The relevant table is titled Retiring Titles. 

### Potential Mentors
At the request of the client, a specific list of potential retirees born in 1965 was generated in order to provide departmental leadership with a list of employees who may be able to mentor other members of the department. This list is extensive. It is recommended that, given the specific nature of a mentoring relationship, this data set be further curated using information such as length of time in current department (which could indicate a wealth of experience and historical knowledge to offer), number of titles previously held at the company (which could indicate a broad experience within the company and an understanding of internal advancement paths), or any historical experience as a people leader (which could indicate a potential history of mentorship). By using these criteria, departmental leaders may be able to narrow down a list of employees who are not only the right age, but also more likely to be a successful mentor.

## Summary
In short, the attached data sets will be useful to the company as a whole in identifying the broad, far-reaching impacts of upcoming retirements. Further data and analysis could include specific title impact within retirement, and more specific criteria useful for identifying potentially successful mentors.
